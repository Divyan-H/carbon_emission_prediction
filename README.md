This project focuses on analyzing a multi-country dataset to predict total carbon emissions (CO2) using a variety of economic, demographic, and environmental features. The workflow began with data preprocessing, where the original Excel dataset was cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and rows with excessive missing values, and feature names were standardized for clarity. The data was then filtered to include only relevant years and countries, and the cleaned dataset was exported for further analysis. Exploratory data analysis was performed by loading the cleaned data into a notebook and visualizing feature correlations with a heatmap to better understand the relationships between variables. For modeling, only numeric features were selected, and the data was split into training and test sets. A Random Forest regression model was trained to predict total CO2 emissions, and its performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score. Finally, feature importances were visualized to interpret which variables have the most significant influence on carbon emissions. This process provides a solid foundation for understanding and modeling the factors that drive carbon emissions across countries.
